Software development is concerned with the **design, development, maintainenance and testing** of code for decentralised applications.

# Objectives 

To build decentralised applications (dApps) that are:

### Performant

Applications are required to run quickly and efficiently and process requests with a high throughput for the given use-case.

### Reliable

Code is robust to adverse edge-cases, can perform during volatile market scenarios and is thoroughly tested for bugs and exploits to protect end-users.
### User-friendly

Interfaces and user interactions are intuitive and sensible, leading to the most desirable experiences.

## Landscape

Blockchains provide a substrate or generalised compute framework for running decentralised code and applications. Over the years smart contract development has evolved into a booming field of software development, with many critical applications from Decentralised Finance to NFTs being run on these programs.

We see a massive opportunity to further the state of the art when it comes to writing smart contract code, especially on nascent blockchains such as Solana.

## Expertise

Sierra provides services across the entire blockchain development stack. 

### Back-end

For smart contract programming we specialise primarily in Solidity and Rust smart contract development, which are two of the most popular languages. 

### Front-end

Our front-end stack tends to revolve around languages like Typescript and respective frameworks such as React.js.

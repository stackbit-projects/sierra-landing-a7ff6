# Objectives 

To build decentralised applications (dApps) that are:

### Performant

Applications are required to run quickly and efficiently and process requests with a high throughput for the given use-case.

### Reliable

Code is robust to adverse edge-cases, can perform during volatile market scenarios and is thoroughly tested for bugs and exploits to protect end-users.
### User-friendly

Interfaces and user interactions are intuitive and sensible, leading to the most desirable experiences.

## Relevance

Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance. 

> The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. 

Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

## Faithful Representation

Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error.

# Objectives

To provide a better understanding of:

1. How users interact with on-chain programs.
2. Analysing key metrics that are of critical importance to the growth and adoptions of decentralised applications.
3. Identify macro trends and new opportunities for growth in the market.

## Areas of focus

### Data Engineering

This involves building reliable data pipelines that feed publically available blockchain data into our databases. Raw data however is only part of the solution, hence rigorous data cleaning and preparation is performed via a series of ingestion pipelines that prepares our data in a format that is best suited to performing analytics.

### Data Science

Investigating patterns and inferring behaviours is the key outcome for our data science capabilities. We look into surface level analytics such as volumes traded on chain and trends for usage and adoption. In future we plan to expand our capabilities into granular transactional analysis, sequence mining and graph-based analysis.
